    <h2>Supporting the transition to a more plant-based diet</h2>
    <img src="assesst/img/pbd-assess.png" alt="Plant-based Diet Assessment" width="1000">
    <p>We proposed two different hypothesis to transit users to a more plant-based diet and tested with 9 people. They are people with relatively diverse backgroud.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Nine 30-min video interviews with friends and family</li>
        <li>3 participants are somewhat worried and 6 are very worried about climate change</li>
        <li>Mix of age, gender, family type, and different levels of knowledge about the connection between food and the environment</li>
        <li>Age groups: 25-40 and 45+</li>
        <li>All participants are relatively mid-high income</li>
        <li>Based out of 4 different states: Chicago, Ohio, Florida, Colorado</li>
        <li>Concept Testing: participants spoke out loud while walking through two web-based concepts.</li>
        <li>Followed by an in-depth discussion about their everyday habits and decision making criteria.</li>
    </ul>
