    <h1>Best Before: A systematical way to solve unnoticeable problem</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>
        According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United States "Globally, one-third of the food produced for human consumption – approximately 1.3 billion tonnes – is lost or wasted each year." Food is lost or wasted at each stage of the Chinese food supply chain but, as with other middle-income countries, more food is beginning to be wasted in the consumption stage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Food waste has a dual effect: on the one hand, consumers waste their hard-earned money, and on the other uneaten food contributes to the Greenhouse Effect.
    </p>
    <p>
        Best Before is an APP aiming to solve the food waste problem. I hope that with the help of this APP, families will be more aware of food waste and thus control the release of methane, carbon dioxide to some extent.
    </p>
    <h3>What I did</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Competitive Analysis</li>
        <li>Contextual Inquiry</li>
        <li>Prototyping</li>
        <li>Usability Testing</li>
        <li>UX/UI Design</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Know our users</h2>
    <p>I interviewed 10 people with different habits of dealing with food. Some of them live alone, some of them live with their parents or kids and I tried to figure out their needs and pain points in food storage.</p>
    <h3>Possible Directions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>How might we design a system which can help users input data easily?</li>
        <li>How might we provide users with popular recipes to cook the food they don't want to eat?</li>
        <li>How might we reduce users' burden to remember the expiration time?</li>
    </ul>
