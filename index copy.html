    <p>I'm the second year Meds student at ID IIT. Previously, I was a UI designer in China. Iâ€™m passionate about <em>understanding human behavior and human nature</em>. I believe interaction design is to design human behavior and how people interact with the environment, products, and people. I always pay attention to the details of users, trying to dig deeper and find the real needs of them.</p>
    <p>I am currently pursuing my Masters of Design at the ID, Illinois Institute of Technology to deepen my ability to drive strategic impact for organizations.</p>
